            <p>The abstract adjective and interaction design principle I have chosen are "translucent" and "feedback." The objective of my project is to create a website that provides information and offers feedback. Inspired by the sensation of catching falling snowflakes in reality, where each snowflake is unique and follows its own distinct path and speed, I aim to replicate this experience within the web page. Observing the journey of each snowflake after catching it always evokes a sense of novelty and fascination. To enhance the depth of the website and simulate the transparency of snowflakes, I have utilized semi-transparent information wireframes with accompanying headings to contain the website's content. For user interaction convenience, I have added a search bar and a reset button at the top and bottom of the screen respectively. When text is entered into the search bar, if there is a match within the wireframes, the corresponding wireframe becomes translucent orange, making it more visually prominent. The reset button at the bottom of the screen allows users to restore the page to its initial state if it becomes cluttered after interaction. The semi-transparent wireframes with headings enable users to gain a general understanding of the information categories within the web page during rapid browsing. When users are interested in a specific heading, they can hover their mouse over the wireframe to pause its movement and click on the wireframe to explore the complete article. The randomly moving wireframes and dynamic background aim to infuse the overall composition with vitality, while the fixed interaction buttons at the top and bottom of the screen maintain a visual balance, preventing excessive clutter. As the main elements of the website consist of semi-transparent wireframes, I have chosen analogous and complementary colors to highlight the interplay between colors. Additionally, I aimed to evoke the ambiance of a winter breeze, thus preferring gradient colors to achieve a clean and transparent effect. Therefore, I have utilized blue and purple as the main color tones of the website, accompanied by a dynamically transitioning background consisting of five colors. The added pink during interactions serves to accentuate the interactive elements without overwhelming the overall design, while the orange during searches aims to create the most visually striking effect on the screen, distinguishing it from other wireframes. Consequently, the core of the final version of the web page lies in the presentation of different information categories through semi-transparent elements, with the central interaction revolving around the search functionality in the search bar and the display of article content upon mouse click.</p>
